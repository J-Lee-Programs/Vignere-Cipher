# Vignere-Cipher
This vignere cipher is a project for Discrete Structures (CSC-7/CIS-7). It utilizes 3 functions, a crypt key, a encryption function, and a decryption function. This program was made with algorithmic ideas in mind, so how it works is:

1. The user inputs a message and a key, the program will use this key as a reference to hide the message.
2. The key wwill go to the key, where it creates an index of the key.
3. The key is passed on to the encryption, and the input of the message is converted to a char.
4. The char will be run through a for loop, checking for the numerical values of the alphabet.
5. The input will be matched with the key's index, where the result of both are returned.
6. The decryption is essentially the same as the encryption, but the input matched with the key is reversed.

In the making of this program, it was a bit difficult to get idea started up, but utilizing the for loop and checking for every letter seemed to do the trick.

To use the program, use all caps no spaces for your message, and one word all caps for the key.
